# Memorandum on LLaMA2 Fine-Tune for AI Startup

## Introduction

This is a memorandum on the fine-tuning of LLaMA2 for the purpose of creating a competitive AI startup. The goal is to gather deep technical insights and prescient intuition on the nature of fine-tuning in relation to growing a flourishing business in the age of AI. Analysis will be provided on the principles of fine-tuned LLMs and their application to the firm.

It is my belief that an important memo must encapsulate the essence and importance of an subject matter. It must further provide a framework for understanding the subject matter and it's implications. It should be a document that is remembered and referenced. The document should suggest actionable plans for the future. It should be forward thinking and forward looking.

To this effect, I leverage the book, *"Competing in the Age of AI"*, which provides many case studies in the nature of AI firms; it summarizes the economic landscape of AI, teaches the basic fundamentals of business, and additionally offers many a predictions for the course of AI. The business model and operating model of the LLaMA2 fine-tune will be contextualized in the framework set forth in the book. I will be providing a brief analysis in the practical, actionable, and build-able applications that can arise from a LLAMA2 fine-tune, to the purpose of formulating a workable business and operational model.

## Technical Details - Insight and Intuition

The principles laid forth by this memo is synthesized from the experience gained through the implementation of a LLaMA2 fine-tune. The technical details of the fine-tune are as follows:
  
  - Training data is sourced from Kaggle and synthetically populated with OpenAI'S ChatGTP-4
  - Fine-tuning is then executed on Colab's compute using code available from the Github's Open Source community

This implementation of a LLaMA2 fine-tune heavily leverages the existing AI/ML ecosystem: Kaggle for datasets, Colab for training, Meta and HuggingFace for models, Github for repository, Replit for presentation, and the OpenSource community and OpenAI for code.

The process and the pipeline itself is self-devised and manually implemented. 
  
  - The training data is sourced from Kaggle and synthetically populated with OpenAI'S ChatGTP-4
  - Fine-tuning is then executed on Colab's compute using code available from the Github's Open Source community
  - The resultant fine-tuned models are then uploaded to HuggingFace
  - Inference is used to generate the new fine-tuned data
  - Evaluation is performed through eye-test and a haphazard benchmark

The exercise leaves the impression of very possible and potential value add. Business scale can be achieved through the automation of manual pain-points through the application of applied software engineering. Business scope will require an concerted effort to understand customer data on a case-by-case basics, but can be formalized leading to automation. Business learning is achieve through an attachment and mutualism to the AI community at large.

## Analysis - What We Can Build

LLaMA2 fine-tune is a stepping stone for better and more advanced AI systems. I believe fine-tuning is but a very narrow use case, and one of many methods, to extract useful information from existing foundational models. However, I also believe all these techniques build towards ever more performant systems.

To this end, I propose building LLaMA interns. A fully realized product will be able to perform any knowledge based white-collar work - granted a formalized and automated way of processing domain specific data and an automated method for creating a fine-tune for any specific task. People may have had unfounded fears about losing their jobs, until now, were I propose building an actual system to replace everyone with AI in the business context.

## Forward Thinking

A mastiff is a shepard dog... we are herding llamas.

As and startup, our best bet is to set trends that will ultimately continue to propel us... always keep ahead and make sure that the tools that we do leave behind future accelerate our destination.

To the end of what makes a better life. Work to Live, or Live to Work.

The book *"Competing in the Age of AI"* provides many case studies in the nature of AI firms, it summarizes the economic landscape of AI and teaches the basic fundamentals of business; additionally, it offers many a prediction in the course for AI.

## My Proposal

I propose that we build and LLaMA intern... in training the intern, a patient approach is necessary. We need to imbue our own domain expertise into the intern. A gentle touch... green thumbs... a patient approach... as we wait for the intern to grow into a full fledged LLaMA.

In building a company we must constantly ask, "How does our company flourish in the age of AI"

We as a startup must put AI first in designing our company...

operating architecture, and building the right skills, capabilities, and culture to drive an increasingly digital operating model

no field will remain untouched by AI

universal engine of execution

leverage the work done by AI, who work in realtime in their runtime.

AI woven into the fabric of the firm

Increasing levels of digitization, analytics, and AI/ML can dramatically improve the scalability of a business

build a company based on AI/ML foundations

full potential opportunities and challenges

"build upon existing expertise"

“target new processes to digitize and enable, through analytics and AI”

different kind of company - 

“changing the way it gathers and uses data, reacts to information, makes operating decisions, and executes operating tasks.”

How to be a competitive company in the age of AI.

How is this more important than anything else that needs to be remembered.

This is a fine-tune of the LLaMA2 model on a dataset of interview questions. The goal is to create a model that can generate interview answers given a question.

## Setup Instructions (Guide)

### Data Generation

one thing to note is that one can use GPT4 or other LLMs to generate synthetic data. This is a good way to generate a lot of data for fine-tuning. The intuition here is that data modeling and structuring the data is important if one wants to leverage existing training pipelines.

### Training Run
The executable code is in a colab notebook located in this repo.

## The Human Element

Inspired by "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost

love, career, life
&
work that enables us to enjoy the range of human experience

i need something to click for me
I need a way to allow LLM fine-tunning to connect to the bigger picture of life.
The only way I know how to do this is to really search for a connection here.
Web - understanding the web of life

Giving a voice and a perspective to AI
Adding that to the lexicon of the foundational models

Humor and Humility

fun, excitement, mental stimulation
being aware, being present, being mindful

How does AGI help create a better world?
More important how does AGI help spread the vibe of a better world?

LLMs as a stepping stone to AGI.

atmosphere and environment - business climate
preparation

personally i can not pursue them both

i can only choose to pursue one thing
we can contemplate and plan things out in the long term
as far as our predictive capabilities

the other path is something that not many have done
it looks more promising because i can beak new ground
but all the same people have done it, just not currently

the road is equally as i contemplate them
not one step has been taken yet
go and take one way
but it be a decision that can't be taken back

Work and career is a deeply personal things that affects one's whole life - taking things seriously is important

this will be remembered
i will tell of this story
i will take the decision that is less traveled
that will make things interesting

## AI Assistance

Collaboration is needed between humans and AI

We'll need to balance the ethical grounding between keeping humans in the loop and the business incentives to remove humans from the loop.

One approach is to be fully present and mindful - while bringing AI technologies to market. Attention is what we'll need ... to model patterns as they emerge. We risk missing key insights from each iteration of of the process otherwise. That's how we'll achieve learning.

Fulfillment - While impressive benchmarks motivate, fulfillment comes from enjoying the journey of inquiry and discovery in training. The creative process of designing prompts, datasets and experiments can be profoundly fulfilling.


Community - Leveraging public datasets, code bases and the broader AI community support during training is key. More eyes on a problem reduces the risk of blind spots.  Feedback from collaborators

Making History - Training a state-of-the-art LLM like LLaMA2 provides an opportunity to push boundaries in AI. The insights from analyzing model behavior during training could open new frontiers in understanding language and reasoning.

Purpose & Meaning - When training an LLM, having a clear purpose and measurable metrics of success are important. 

What specific skills do you want the model to acquire?

How will you evaluate if training is effective?

Aligning training objectives with end goals gives meaning and direction.





Building a company through an iterative agile process ...

Patience and presence enables learning.
